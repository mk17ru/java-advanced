Homework 13. Text statistics
Create a TextStatistics application that parses texts in different languages.
Command line arguments: text locale, output locale, text file, report file.
Supported text locales: All locales available on the system.
Supported output locales: Russian and English.
The files are encoded in UTF-8.
The statistics should be calculated according to the following categories:
offers,
the words,
numbers,
money,
dates.
For each category, the following statistics should be collected: number of occurrences, number of distinct values, minimum value, maximum value, minimum length, maximum length, mean / length.
Sample report:
The parsed file "input.txt"
Summary statistics
    Number of offers: 43.
    The number of words: 275.
    Number of numbers: 40.
    Number of sums: 3.
    Number of dates: 3.
Offer statistics
    Number of offers: 43 (43 different).
    Minimum sentence: "Command line arguments: text locale, output locale, text file, report file.".
    Maximum sentence: "Number of numbers: 40.".
    Minimum sentence length: 13 ("Number of dates: 3.").
    Maximum sentence length: 211 ("GK: if you put a real sentence here, then the process will not converge").
    Average sentence length: 55.465.
Word statistics
    Number of words: 275 (157 different).
    Minimum word: "GK".
    Maximum word: "languages".
    Minimum word length: 1 ("s").
    Maximum word length: 14 ("TextStatistics").
    Average word length: 6.72.
Statistics by numbers
    Number of numbers: 40 (24 different).
    Minimum number: -12345,0.
    Maximum number: 12345,67.
    Average: 207.676.
Amount of money statistics
    Number of amounts: 3 (3 different).
    Minimum amount: $100,00.
    Maximum amount: $345,67.
    Average amount: $100,20.
Date statistics
    Number of dates: 3 (3 different).
    Minimum date: 22/1/21
    Maximum date: 8/1/21
    Average date: 8/2/21
You can count on all of the text to fit in memory.
When completing the assignment, you should pay attention to:
Decomposition of messages for localization
Matching messages by gender and number
Write tests that verify the above application behavior.
It is recommended to use JUnit (Tutorial) to implement tests. Lots of usage examples can be found in the tests.
If you are familiar with another testing framework (like TestNG), then you can use it.
You cannot use self-written frameworks and tests run through main.
